    "body": "The forest shines and shows its green\nIt's steam, the leaves, their sheen is seen\nA thousand stories wrapped in time\nwith rays of light that bugs do climb\n\nAbove and under, fauna moves\nWith rhythm, oozing lots of groove\nTwo lovebirds hold and watch the sight\nTheir love glows white with hours of flight\n\n\"A friend for life, at last\", he sighed\nShe met his gaze with big round eyes\nA wing outstretched, a gentle pet\ncreates vignettes of love duet\n\nThe tree can feel their warmth, their song\nShe'll see the world, he'll come along\nThe creatures, mangos, eggs they'll see\nWith sights in mind, they'll leave the tree\n\nBefore they go and take off flight\nHe sings a song and holds her tight."
