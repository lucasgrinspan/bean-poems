                    This page tracks the amount of users that visit each site, but I managed to do
                    it in a way that is more performant and privacy focused than Google Analytics
                    using the secret technique of removing half of the features. Just kidding, but
                    it is unique in the way that it uses zero cookies while still ensuring that a
                    visitor is unique without being able to identify them.
                </p>
            </header>
            <h2 class="heading">How it works</h2>
            <p>
                Each person that visits my site brings with them some information that can be used
                to make a unique identifier for them. The server code combines all of this
                information into a single hash using SHA256. Specifically, the information is:
            </p>
            <ul class="body-text list">
                <li>IP address</li>
                <li>User Agent</li>
                <li>Current day</li>
                <li>Current page</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="body-text">
                This means that we can count views across pages without being able to track a
                specific user's history. If a page has already seen a hash, then that is a repeat
                visitor, but that visitor will have a completely new hash if they decide to visit
                another page! All that appears to me is a list of hashes that visited a route. There
                is no way for me to extract anything meaningful from the hashes. This is what it
                looks like to me:

            <h2 class="heading">Implementation</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
                Before the information gets hashed, a random base 36 number gets thrown into the
                hash as well. This number is regenerated every 24 hours by the server. This ensures
                that visits are counted by day. For example, a person viewing a specific poem across
                two days will count as two views for that poem, allowing for some rudimentary
                session tracking.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                This is what the hash generator looks like. If <code>pageSpecific</code> is
                <code>false</code>, then the hash is used to track visits to the site, which will
                still be completely different from hashes used for specific pageviews.
            </p>
            <pre class="code block">
const generateUniqueId = (req, pageSpecific) => {
    const ip = req.ip;
    const ua = req.get("user-agent");
    const date = new Date().getDate().toString();
    let uniqueID = randomString + ip + ua + date;
    if (pageSpecific) {
        // add the page to the hash
        const page = req.originalUrl;
        uniqueID += page;
    }
    return crypto.createHash("sha256").update(uniqueID).digest("base64");
};

            <p class="body-text">
                I think there's a lot of value in this type of cookie-less analytics. Even though
                there's some good stuff here, there's a lot missing. For example, bounce rate and
                more detailed session tracking would be really cool to see implemented.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                I think
                <code
                    ><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon"
                        >Navigator.sendBeacon()</a
                    ></code
                >
                would work really well in conjunction with <code>window.unload</code> to provide
                specific timings of a session. The other obvious features that are missing are
                geographical data from visitors and user retention analysis. That last one probably
                can't be done within the constraints of this analytics framework.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Right now, the analytics module is cleverly implemented as express middleware so
                that a programmer can simply use <code>app.use(analyticsMiddleware)</code> at the
                beginning of their server code to have simple plug-and-play analytics on all routes
                of their site.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Who knows? I might continue working on it and publish it as an npm module. If I do,
                I'll update this page.
